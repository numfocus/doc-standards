# Documentation standards and resources for NumFOCUS projects websites

The aim of this repository is to define some standards that NumFOCUS projects can implement.
This will allow users of different projects to have a consistent experience accross websites
of different projects. And will make it easier to navigate websites that can possibly have:

- A common terminology to refer to the sections
- The same order (which section appears first...)

## Origin

The creation of this document started in the discussions to unify the navigation of
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).
See https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/43

The discussion continued at the [NumFOCUS summit 2019](https://numfocus.org/summit2019)
with a session about websites. Notes have been copied to: #1
